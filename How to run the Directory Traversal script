To run your Python script on a Windows system, follow these steps:

âœ… Step 1: Save the Script
Open Notepad or any text editor. Paste your script into the editor.

Save the file as vuln2.py in a directory of your choice, for example, C:\Users\kanjeng\Downloads.

âœ… Step 2: Open Command Prompt
Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
In the Command Prompt window, navigate to the directory where your script is saved. For example:
    cd C:\Users\kanjeng\Downloads

âœ… Step 3: Run the Script
Execute the script by typing:
    python vuln2.py

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might need to specify the version:
python3 vuln2.py
If Python is not recognized, ensure it's added to your system's PATH environment variable.

âœ… Step 4: Provide Input When Prompted
The script will prompt:
Enter file name:

Type the name of the file you wish to read, such as:
secret.txt

Ensure that the file exists within the C:\Users\kanjeng\Downloads directory. 
The script includes a security check to prevent directory traversal attacks, so it will only access files within this base directory.

ðŸ”’ Security Note
The script is designed to prevent directory traversal by verifying that the requested file resides within the specified base directory. 
This means inputs like ..\..\secret.txt will result in an "Access denied" message, ensuring that files outside the intended directory cannot be accessed.
