1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Check for outdated Python packages:
  pip list --outdated

This will display a list of installed packages and their current versions vs available latest versions.

3. Upgrade an outdated package:
For example, to upgrade the requests library:
  pip install --upgrade requests

4. (Optional) Upgrade all packages using a script:
You can use this one-liner to upgrade all outdated packages automatically:
  pip list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U

💡 Note: This is best used in virtual environments to avoid affecting system-wide packages.
🛡️ Security Tip:
To automate checking for outdated packages and known vulnerabilities, consider tools like:

pip-audit:

pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
